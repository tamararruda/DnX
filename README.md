**Requirements**

We have built this implementation using:

 * PyTorch 
 * PyTorch Geometric

Folder description:
  * trained_gcn: contains the models that will be explained
  * trained_distiller: contains the distilled models
  * explanation: contains the explanations generated by our models

file description
  * `model.py`: the model used to distill.
  * `utils.py`: all functions used to load, save and evaluate the dataset
  * `main_distiller.py`: code with the functions to distill the models to be explained
  * `main_syn.ipynb`: notebook to perform the task of generating explanations for the synthetic datasets
  
Datasets: 

The nomenclature (syn1, syn2 ...., syn6) is used to facilitate experiments

  * BA-HouseShapes (syn1), 
  * BA-Community (syn2), 
  * BA-Grids (syn3), 
  * Tree-Cycles (syn4), 
  * TreeGrids (syn5), 
  * BA-Bottle-Shaped (syn6) 

To run the DnX and Fast DnX explainers for the synthetic datasets just run the notebook `main_syn.ipynb`:
